# FluidSynth with Emscripten-specific patch

This repository is based on [FluidSynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth) repository, and contains some changes to build with Emscripten.

The original README is here: [README.original.md](./README.original.md)

## Build (enikey87)

Prerequisites (Debian/Ubuntu): `git python3 wget xz-utils cmake make pkg-config autoconf automake libtool`; CMake 3.24 or newer (the bundled signalsmith-audio-basics requires it).

```shell
./build_libsndfile.sh   # libsndfile + ogg/vorbis/flac/opus into ../libsndfile-emscripten; build.sh needs it for the sf3 variants
./build.sh              # every libfluidsynth-X.X.X*.js / .wasm variant into ./dist
```

`build.sh` also checks out the `gcem` and `signalsmith-audio-basics` submodules (constexpr math, limiter and reverb engines). Both scripts source `emsdk-env.sh`, which installs Emscripten `3.1.10` (override with `EMSDK_VERSION`) into `../emsdk` unless `emcmake` is already on `PATH`. An `emcmake` you provide yourself must run with node < 18: 3.1.10 output calls the global `fetch` node 18+ ships, and autoconf's run test fails with `cannot run C compiled programs`.

## Install

```shell
npm install @songsterr/fluidsynth-emscripten   # @songsterr scope resolves to npm.terra.songsterr.com
```

## CI

Builderr (`.builderr.yml`) runs on every push: fluidsynth's own `make check` natively, and the full wasm build with `dist/` attached as artifacts, then `test/wasm/smoke.mjs` loads every variant the way consumers do (exports, sf2/sf3 loading, rendering, callbacks, the MIDI player). A push to `main` also publishes that CI-built `dist/` as `@songsterr/fluidsynth-emscripten` to `npm.terra.songsterr.com`, unless `package.json`'s version is already there — bump `version` to release.

## Build with Docker (enikey87)

A single command builds every variant into `./dist`:

```shell
docker compose run --rm --build --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" builder
```

`--user` keeps the artifacts owned by you rather than by root. The image carries a
prebuilt libsndfile (needed for sf3), so a rebuild only recompiles fluidsynth.

## Build (from jet2jet)

> Tested with Emscripten version 3.1.10.

1. (Optional) Update `emscripten/exports.txt`, containing export functions for JS program
    * The script `emscripten/make-exports.cjs` will update this automatically, gathering functions from `include` directory.
2. Make sure that Emscripten is usable on the current environment
3. Make `build` directory
4. Enter `build` directory and execute `emcmake cmake -Denable-oss=off -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
    * If no other options are specified, and `cmake` is running with `emcmake` (or `emconfigure`), the build configurations are initialized for Emscripten-build mode.
5. In `build` directory, execute `emmake make`

After successful build, `libfluidsynth-<version>.js` will be created at `build/src` directory.

* If `enable-debug` specified on the `cmake` execution (e.g. `emcmake cmake -Denable-debug=on ..`), a map file `libfluidsynth-<version>.wasm.map` is also generated.
    * Currently it seems that it cannot be used.
* If `enable-separate-wasm` specified on the `cmake` execution (e.g. `emcmake cmake -Denable-separate-wasm=on ..`), `libfluidsynth-<version>.wasm` and `libfluidsynth-<version>.wast` are also generated.
    * For AudioWorklet, you cannot use `*.wasm` file directly.
* In Emscripten-build mode, standalone application named `fluidsynth` is not emitted.

## Build static library for Emscripten

Please specify `-D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=off` on calling emcmake. (e.g. `emcmake cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=off ..`)

In this mode, you can also build sources under `doc` directory (e.g. `cd build/doc && make fluidsynth_simple -j16`), although all exportable functions will be exported.

## Usage

Place `libfluidsynth-<version>.js` file to your space and load `libfluidsynth-<version>.js`. After load, almost all FluidSynth API functions are accessible via `Module` object (note that all function names have the prefix `_`).

To use `libfluidsynth-<version>.js` in AudioWorklet, load it into AudioWorklet before your worklet JS file. In your worklet JS file, you can access `Module` object via `AudioWorkletGlobalScope.wasmModule`.

## Miscellaneous

### Per-track audio groups (opt-in)

Set `synth.per-track-audio` to `1` before creating the synth, and set
`synth.audio-channels`, `synth.audio-groups`, and `synth.effects-groups` to the SMF
track count. The setting defaults to `0`: existing stereo playback is unchanged.
Check that setting the option succeeds before using this mode with a WASM build.

This mode assumes the channel layout this fork's SMF loader produces: each track
uses melodic channels 0–8 and drum channel 9, and is remapped onto ten private
MIDI channels, so at most 25 tracks fit into the default 256 MIDI channels. Each
track keeps its own drum channel across reset and seek. Channel controllers,
program changes, and pitch bends remain within that track. Audio and
reverb/chorus are routed to the same track group. Always set `synth.effects-groups`
equal to `synth.audio-groups`: it defaults to 1, and then the reverb/chorus of
every track is mixed into group 0 while the other groups play dry — silently,
with no error.
Render all groups with `fluid_synth_process`; fewer output groups intentionally
wrap/mix according to the normal FluidSynth group semantics. As before, callers
must zero output buffers before rendering. General SMF channel layouts and
device-specific SysEx channel reassignment are not supported by this mode.

* Currently only several APIs are tested. Some APIs such as for drivers may not work.
